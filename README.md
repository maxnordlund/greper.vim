# greper.vim

This vim plugin improves searching for literals and with regular
expressions, using a simple syntax.

It unifies under a single name, different tools like [ag][ag],
[ack][ack] and [grep][grep].

It provides a new set of commands, (recommended) mappings and easy
navigation of the search results window.

Read the [help][vim-doc] to know more.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim][pathogen], and then simply copy and paste:

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/zehrizzatti/greper.vim.git
```
